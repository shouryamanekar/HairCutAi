## Contributing Guidelines

### Issue Selection
- Look through the [Issues](https://github.com/shouryamanekar/haircut-recommendation-system/issues) tab to find tasks labelled as `hacktoberfest`, `good first issue`, or `help wanted`.
- If you'd like to work on an issue, please feel free to comment on it to let us know you're taking it on.

### Code Standards
Please follow these coding conventions for consistency:
- **Python** (Backend): Follow PEP 8 standards. Use `black` or `flake8` for linting.
- **JavaScript** (Frontend): Use ESLint to ensure consistency.
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and commits.
- **Documentation**: Document your code where necessary, especially functions or methods that might not be self-explanatory.

### Testing
Ensure any features or fixes include relevant tests to verify functionality. For Python, use `unittest` or `pytest`. For JavaScript, consider using `Jest` or a similar testing library.

### Commit Messages
Write clear, concise commit messages:
- **Format**: Use the format `[type]: description`.
- **Types**: `feat` (feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation changes), `style` (formatting, missing semi-colons), `refactor` (code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature), `test` (adding or updating tests), `chore` (updating build tasks, package manager configs).
  
Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add face shape classifier using CNN model."
```

### Pull Requests
1. **Push Changes**: Once your changes are complete, push them to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and open a pull request (PR) from your forked branch. Provide a clear and concise description of what your PR accomplishes.

3. **Link to Issues**: If your PR addresses an issue, include `Closes #issue-number` in the PR description.

4. **Reviews**: Be open to feedback! Maintainers may request changes to ensure that all contributions meet project standards.
