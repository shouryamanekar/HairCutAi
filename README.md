# AI-Powered Haircut Recommendation System

## Overview
The AI-Powered Haircut Recommendation System is an application designed to analyze a user’s facial features and recommend suitable hairstyles. By using facial recognition, machine learning, and an extensive hairstyle database, the system provides personalized haircut suggestions based on the user’s unique face shape and hair characteristics.

## Project Goals
- **Facial Feature Analysis**: Detect key facial landmarks to accurately determine face shape.
- **Face Shape Classification**: Categorize user faces into shapes like round, oval, and square.
- **Personalized Haircut Recommendations**: Suggest hairstyles tailored to each face shape and hair type.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a smooth user experience for photo uploads and viewing recommendations.
- **Optional Augmented Reality (AR) Feature**: Allow users to try on hairstyles virtually for a more engaging experience.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- **GPU**: Recommended for training facial analysis models.
- **High-Resolution Camera**: Allows users to upload clear images for accurate analysis.

### Software
- **Programming Languages**: 
  - Python (Backend and Model Development)
  - JavaScript (Frontend for User Interactivity)
- **Libraries**:
  - **Backend**: OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Scikit-learn
  - **Frontend**: React or Vue, Three.js (for AR/3D effects)
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Platform**: Docker for containerized deployment (optional)

### Datasets
- **Face Shape Dataset**: A collection of facial images annotated with facial landmarks and shape classifications.
- **Hairstyle Dataset**: Includes hairstyles tagged by face shape compatibility, gender, and hair type.

## System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Image Upload**: Users upload a facial image.
2. **Facial Feature Extraction**: The system detects facial landmarks.
3. **Face Shape Classification**: The model classifies the face shape.
4. **Haircut Matching**: Hairstyles that complement the face shape are recommended from the database.
5. **Result Display**: The recommended hairstyles are shown, with an optional “try-on” feature using AR.

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: User interface for image upload, recommendations, and AR.
- **Backend**:
  - Facial analysis and face shape classification.
  - Recommendation algorithm and API for database interactions.
- **Database**: Stores haircut information, face shape classifications, and user preferences.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shouryamanekar/haircut-recommendation-system.git
cd haircut-recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
- **Python Dependencies** (Backend):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **JavaScript Dependencies** (Frontend):
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

### 3. Database Setup
- Configure and connect MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user data and hairstyle recommendations.

### 4. Running the Application
- **Backend**:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- **Frontend**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start
  ```

### 5. Docker (Optional)
For a containerized deployment, use Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Usage
1. **Upload Image**: Users can upload a facial image through the UI.
2. **View Recommendations**: The system will analyze the image and suggest suitable hairstyles.
3. **Try On Hairstyles (AR Optional)**: Users can “try on” hairstyles in real-time using the AR feature.

## Key Functionalities

- **Facial Feature Analysis**: Uses facial landmarks to determine face shape.
- **Face Shape Classification**: Machine learning model classifies user face shapes (e.g., round, oval, square).
- **Haircut Recommendation**: Database query returns the most suitable hairstyles based on the classified face shape.
- **Augmented Reality (Optional)**: Try-on feature allows users to overlay hairstyles in real-time.

## Testing and Evaluation
- **Facial Recognition**: Ensure accuracy of facial landmark detection across different lighting and image qualities.
- **Face Shape Classification**: Validate model precision and recall for each face shape category.
- **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback to refine hairstyle recommendations.
- **AR Testing**: Ensure hairstyle alignment accuracy in the try-on mode.

## Future Enhancements
- **Extended Face Shape Customization**: Add additional face shapes for finer recommendations.
- **Hairstyle Customization**: Allow users to adjust hairstyle parameters like length and color.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with advanced neural networks for enhanced performance.
